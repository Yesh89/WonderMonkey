This is a simple story of a monkey with high will power whose dream was to visit all seven wonders of the world. He one day decides to pick up his bicycle and begins his voyage to tour the world.

How to play:
Simple! don't let the ambitious monkey fall. Your single tap can save his life and his dream.

Tips :
>The cycle doesn't have breaks. You can't avoid acceleration but you can certainly delay it.
> This game will test your patience more than speed.
> Wait and wait until the tilt indicator reaches red. This gives you ample time for your next click.
> Be cautious, after all he is cycling on a slippery rope.

Enjoy the low bit game :)
